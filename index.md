## Sex, Violence and Simian viruses
James Lester

---

## What?

> * Looking at the viruses of a red colobus population living within Kibale National Park
> * Considering <a href="url">SIV</a>, <a href="url">SFV</a>, <a href="url">SPgV</a>, <a href="url">SHFV1</a> and <a href="url">SHFV2</a>
> * Access to a combination of demographic, viral presence/absence, behavioural and sequence data (which match up to varying degrees)

---

## Why? (Academic)

> * Whilst we're very aware of the existence and zoonotic potential of viruses such as SIV and SFV, we still know relatively little of their wildlife dynamics
> * Various studies have approached single viruses in the past, but typically very "disconnected" overall
> * Faecal virological data alone, occasionally with age, or with maternal relations, or dominance hierarchy

---

## Why? (General)

> * Primate zoonoses remain a concern - Precedent set by SIV, albeit with this clearly indicated to be a rare consequence likely borne of an unusual set of circumstances.
> * Better understanding how these pathogens behave in the wild may better inform us about if and how they could pose a risk to the human population
> * Also, interesting from a wildlife disease epidemiology perspective

---

## Which?

> * Whilst SIV really should be familiar to you all, others may well be less so
> * Simian Foamy Virus - Retrovirus transmitted through saliva
> * Simian Haemorrhagic Fever Viruses - Arteriviruses transmitted through ???
> * Simian Pegivirus - Flavivirus transmitted *maybe* through sexual, vertical and parenteral routes

---

## An update on last year

> * LVZ 2015 - Beginning to unpick behavioural dataset
> * Mid 2015 - Viral takeover - Behavioural work drifts away
> * End 2015 - Virus-level analysis "complete"

--- 

## Virus-level findings, in (very) brief
> * Age-dependent accumulation of all viruses, especially in males
> * Coinfection at the level of viral presence, and sequence co-clustering for the SHFV viruses
> * Detection of viral clusters between siblings for all viruses, between mother-offspring pairs for SHFV2
> * Non-familial clustering between some male-female pairs for SHFV1 + 2
> * <font color=#a23>Positive correlation between enacting aggressive behaviour in year of sampling (2012) and SHFV infection status</font>

---

## Where next? 

> * 3 years of copulatory/agonistic data
> * Alongside 9 years of general behavioural data
> * One-off virus sampling sampling in 2012 + 2010

---

## Synthesising behavioural and virological data

> * 3 years of sociosexual behaviour provide a basis to consider the relationship between grooming interactions, nearest-neighbour interactions and agonism/copulation.
> * This is a basis which can then be expanded into many years of past behaviour
> * And of course, alongside this, infection status and relatedness

---

## Key aims of this work

> * Key aims of this are to identify patterns of associative/affiliative patterns of behaviour, and demographic factors, which seem associated with agonistic behaviour/copulation
> * How these behaviours change over the course of the substantial timeframe considered as individuals move between age classes etc.
> * And therein, how these then relate to infection status
