### The context of viral transmission in Kibale National Park

*** =left

- KNP a 776 km<sup>2</sup> area of protected forest
- Diverse primate community
- Of great conservation, and potential zoonosis interest

### Our reservoir of interest - Kibale red colobus

*** =left

- Especially sensitive to environmental change
- Live in multi-male groups of 19-80 individuals
- Predated by chimps
- Known hosts of **SIV**, **SFV**, **SPgV** and **SHFV1/2**

*** =right

### Viruses of interest: **SIV** and **SFV**

- **SIV**
  - Considerable variation in prevalence between populations, fluid transmission
  - <p>Relatively low prevalences identified within Kibale RCB, as opposed to Ta&iuml; and others</p> 
  - Associated with dominance rank in sooty mangabeys
- **SFV**
  - Consistently observed at high prevalence within RCB populations, salivary transmission
  - Maternal clustering identified within chimpanzees

---

### Viruses of interest: SHFV(1/2) and SPgV

- **SHFV(1/2)**
  - Only recently identified in the wild, no previous epidemiology
  - Previously involved in research facility outbreaks, able to readily spread amongst infected hosts, not airborne
- **SPgV**
  - Similarly, only recently identified within wild-living primates, no previous epidemiology
  - Has a human analog - HPgV
  - Associated with presence of other blood-borne or sexually transmitted infections
  - Vertical transmission, either prenatal or during birth
  
---

### Our approach

- Deep sequencing of blood samples from two red colobus troops
  - Allowing us to obtain full-length genomes for **SHFV(1/2)** and **SPgV**
  - Alongside clear identification of coinfections
  - Able to use sequencing not just as a diagnostic tool, but also to cluster infections
- Monthly behavioural scans for one of these groups over several consecutive days, with one focal red colobus troop
- Microsatellite data for each sampled individual

### Our approach (cont.)

### Key questions
- What are the demographic correlates of infection with these viruses?
- Do they associate with each other?
- Does infection with these viruses relate to patterns of behaviour?
- Can viral clustering be related to this?

### Patterns of coinfection

### Patterns of infection clustering

### Behavioural correlates of infection

### Behavioural correlates of infection clustering

### Conclusions
- Strong indications of age-associated accumulation of infection in certain contexts - Particularly females
- Indications of both horizontal and vertical transmission
- Co-infection with only the **SHFV** viruses indicated
- Association between agonistic, copulatory and associative behaviour and SHFV infection, not so for **GBV** and **SIV**

---

### Remaining questions and further work

- Low prevalence of **SIV**, and lack of association with dominance
- High **SPgV** prevalence with no association with dominance - Patterns of recovery and immunity?
- Why **SHFV** relates so strongly to patterns of agonism and other indications of social dominance?
- Requires further analysis of within-sample viral diversity
- Longitudinal viral sampling, for molecular clock calibration and potential dating of divergence
